<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Francisco E. Paez, and this is my <i>awesome</i> homepage (always under construction.)</p>
I have a Computer Science PhD from <a href="http://www.uns.edu.ar">UNS</a> and got my grad degree at Computer Science from UNPSJB. I am a JTP (Jefe de Trabajos Pr√°ticos) at <a href="http://www.unp.edu.ar/">UNPSJB</a> and a member of the <a href="http://www.rtsg.unp.edu.ar/">Real-Time Systems Group</a> at UNPSJB on Puerto Madryn.<br/>
<hr />

<h3>Research areas</h3>
My primary research areas are real-time and embedded systems, in particular real-time operating systems, schedulability methods, memory administration and the design and verification of real-time systems.

<h3>Software</h3>
I use both Windows and Linux as personal operating systems, as sooner or later both of them will make you mourn someday.
Said that, I really like <a href="https://www.fsf.org/es">free software</a>, and kind of support it. And I think that you too should do it :)
<ul>
<li>Some stuff in my <a href="https://github.com/fepz">GitHub repos</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My other interests...</h3>
