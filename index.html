<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Francisco E. Paez, and this is my <i>awesome</i> homepage (always under construction.)</p>
I'm a Computer Science PhD student at <a href="http://www.uns.edu.ar">UNS</a> / <a href="http://www.conicet.gov.ar/new_scp/detalle.php?keywords=&id=40065&datos_academicos=yes">CONICET</a>. I am also a Assistant Professor at <a href="http://www.unp.edu.ar/">UNPSJB</a> and a research fellow in the <a href="http://www.rtsg.unp.edu.ar/">Real-Time Systems Group</a> at UNPSJB on Puerto Madryn. I got my degree at Computer Science from UNPSJB.<br/>

<h3>Software</h3>
I use both Windows and Linux as personal operating systems, as sooner or later both of them will make you mourn someday.
Said that, I really like <a href="https://www.fsf.org/es">free software</a>, and kind of support it. And I think that you too should do it :)
<ul>
<li>Some stuff in my <a href="https://github.com/fepz">GitHub repos</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>My other interests...</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm a amateur photographer. You could see my photos on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fpaez/">Flickr</a>.</li>
<li>Not a music freak, but I'm into it. Check what i'm listening in <a href="http://www.lastfm.es/user/zumba">last.fm</a>.</li>
